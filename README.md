## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   The sources I used to help complete my submission were [ https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp ]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [The biggest challenge in completing my submission was all the new syntax I had to get accustomed to. Previously I had never used HTML or CSS, and really only a small amount of JavaScript. Getting to know all these different aspects of webpage development was an interesting experience. To overcome this challenge, I relied on all my previous knowledge with computer programming. Although syntax may be different, a lot of the same concepts learned in one programming language can be applied into many others.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   The many questions about web development that I have would be what is the role of a web developer? I’d love to understand what a web developers’ day to day routine would like in a professional environment. What kind of platforms and languages should I make myself familiar with in web development? Understanding the toolsets and programs used the creation of a webpage is a key aspect to understand how a typical work environment would like. What differences are there from developing on mobile platforms and desktop platforms. What kind of teamwork setting are involved in web development? How are members of that team adequately communicating in order to finish a product?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I would spend the extra hours implementing features such as randomly occuring patterns and one feature that I think would be really cool would be a feature to go against other people. Connecting to random people that visit the site and allow them to go head to head and see who can last with progressively harder patterns to follow. This would be a true meaning of a webpage by connecting other people from all around the globe together. ]
